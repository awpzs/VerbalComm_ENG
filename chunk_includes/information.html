<li><p><strong>Research Project Title: Referential communication</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Background, aims of project </strong></p>
<p>You're invited to take part in a study investigating how language users achieve successful communication verbally. We hope this will enhance our understanding of the processes that underlie language communication.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Why have I been invited to take part?</strong></p>
<p>You have been asked to participate because we want to understand how native speakers of British English, who are monolingual and non-dyslexic, and are aged less than 30 years old, produce descriptions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do I have to take part?</strong></p>
<p>No, you don't have to take part, and participation in this study is voluntary. You may withdraw from this study at any time without giving a reason and without getting any penalty.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What will happen if I take part?</strong></p>
<p>You will be asked to describe common objects to the hypothetical listener. The experiment takes approximately 25-30 minutes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Are there any potential risks in taking part?</strong></p>
<p>There is no known risk involved in this study.</p></li>

<p>The research data will be anonymised and only the research team will have access to these data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Analyses</strong></p>

<p>Due to the nature of this research, it is very likely that other researchers may find the data to be useful in answering other research questions. We will ask for your explicit consent for your anonymised responses to be kept for a minimum of 10 years and shared in this way and, if you agree, we will ensure that the data collected is untraceable back to you before letting others use it.</p></li>

<p>Please read the instructions carefully, and tick each point.</p>
<p><input type="checkbox">This study examines how people describe objects, so that listeners can identify them.</p>
<p><input type="checkbox">In each trial, you'll see a display of some characters and/or objects, as well as a sentence introducing the characters/objects (see below). Please click on the sentence after you've read it.</p>

<p>The man above the sausage is on Number 3.</p>
<p><input type="checkbox">After clicking the sentence, a character/object in the red box will change its location (see below).</p>

<p><input type="checkbox">Your task is to describe this change of location, so listeners, who don't see this change, will understand the new location of the character/object.</p>
<p><input type="checkbox"><strong>You can use pronouns or nouns to describe this change. For example, you could describe the change as <em>"Now he is on Number 4"</em>, or <em>"Now the man is on Number 4"</em>. Feel free to vary your expressions.</strong></p>
<p><input type="checkbox">Important: only the characters/objects in a red box will change their locations. Sometimes there will be more than one red box, and that means either character/object in the red box can change his/her/its location.</p>
<p><input type="checkbox">Please do not think too much about your responses – we are interested in responses that come to mind first.</p>
